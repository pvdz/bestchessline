  "answer": "This is the starting chess position. Both sides aim to develop pieces, control the center (e4, d4 for White; …e5, …d5 for Black), and castle safely.\n\nFor White, common developing moves include Nf3, Nc3, g3 with Bg2, or the direct e4/d4. For Black, mirror plans apply: …Nf6, …Nc6, …g6 with …Bg7, or a direct …e5/…d5.\n\nFrom an opening-family perspective, the game can transpose into countless systems (Open Games, Reti/English, Closed openings). Study fundamental principles and typical pawn structures at your level to reduce mistakes and recognize familiar plans.",
