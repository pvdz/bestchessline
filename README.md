- **Format Options**: Choose notation format (Short/Long Algebraic) and piece format (Symbols/Letters)

### Running Analysis

1. Set up your desired position on the board
2. Configure analysis parameters
3. Click "Start Analysis" to begin
4. Monitor real-time progress and results
5. Use "Stop" to end the analysis
6. View color-coded arrows on the board showing move quality
7. Click on analysis moves to explore variations

### Understanding Results

Each move result shows:

- **Move Notation**: The move in selected notation format with effects (captures, checks, mates)
- **Score**: Evaluation in centipawns or mate notation
- **Depth**: Search depth reached
- **Nodes**: Number of positions evaluated
- **Time**: Analysis time for this move
- **Principal Variation**: Best line of play following this move
- **Color-Coded Arrows**: Visual indication of move quality on the board
- **Analysis Status**: Real-time progress and depth information

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: Functional TypeScript with modular components
- **Chess Engine**: Stockfish 16.0.0 WebAssembly multi-threaded worker
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with Grid and Flexbox

## Key Features

### Functional Programming

- **Global State Objects**: Clean state management with `appState`, `boardState`, `stockfishState`
- **Pure Functions**: Modular, testable code with clear separation of concerns
- **Event Handling**: Robust event delegation and listener management
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and type checking

### Chess Logic

- **Move Validation**: Comprehensive piece movement rules with path blocking
- **Disambiguation**: Smart piece selection for ambiguous moves
- **Special Moves**: Castling and en passant handling
- **Game Import**: PGN-like notation parsing with comments and annotations

### UI/UX

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reliable piece movement with visual feedback
- **Format Controls**: Dynamic notation and piece format selection
- **Move Navigation**: Game replay with proper state management
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover effects, move arrows, and highlighting
- **Color-Coded Analysis**: Visual arrows showing move quality with score labels
- **Branching System**: Explore variations by clicking analysis moves
- **Analysis Status**: Real-time progress and depth information

## Browser Support

- Chrome/Chromium 67+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 11.1+
- Edge 79+

Requires WebAssembly support for Stockfish engine.

## Performance Tips

1. **Lower Depth**: Use depth 10-15 for faster analysis
2. **Fewer Moves**: Analyze 3-5 moves per side for quicker results
3. **Single Thread**: Use 1 thread for mobile devices
4. **Game Import**: Large games may take a moment to parse

## Troubleshooting

### Stockfish Not Loading

This requires the files to be served with a particular header to support the shared buffers. There's probably a better way but I didn't try to resolve that yet.

- Check that `dist/stockfish.js` and `dist/stockfish-nnue-16.wasm` exist
- Ensure browser supports WebAssembly
- Try refreshing the page

### Analysis Not Starting

- Verify position is valid
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all configuration values are valid

### Drag-and-Drop Issues

- Ensure you're clicking directly on pieces
- Try refreshing the page if issues persist
- Check browser console for errors

### Game Import Problems

- Verify PGN notation is valid
- Check for proper move syntax
- Ensure game starts from a valid position

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # TypeScript watch mode
npm run build        # Build and copy Stockfish files
npm run serve        # Start development server
npm run format       # Run Prettier on the code

# Stockfish files
npm run copy-stockfish  # Copy stockfish-nnue-16.js and stockfish-nnue-16.wasm
```
